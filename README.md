# Windows Performance Application - Python Edition
- Requires admin access and a connection to the internet
- You may get a false positive from your AV, this is because this program makes system changes that Windows does not like
- This is the same as my other [Windows Performance Application]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_ALaS2PTI4](https://github.com/Mr123keelos/WindowsPerformanceApplication)), except this version (Python) includes tweaks that are safe on my PC and the ones I apply on my PC.
- If you want a UI and more tweaks, use the non-Python version
  
# Features
- Automatic file cleaner
- Enable high-performance tweaks
- Disable unwanted services that can cause slow-down
- Disable power saving
- Lightweight, use then remove

# WARNING
- Changing the Windows system is not 100% safe. PLEASE MAKE A RESTORE POINT BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM!
- This program can cause instability in your Windows system. Please read everything!

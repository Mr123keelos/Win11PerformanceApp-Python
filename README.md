# Windows Performance Application - Python Edition
- Requires admin access and a connection to the internet
- You may get a false positive from your AV, this is because this program makes system changes that Windows does not like
- This is the same as my other [Windows Performance Application (Outdated)](https://github.com/Mr123keelos/WindowsPerformanceApplication), except this version (Python) includes only tweaks that I applied on my own PC.
- If you want a UI and more tweaks, use the non-Python version, but keep in mind I will be updating this version

# Requirements
- Windows with admin privileges (to allow the program to make system changes)
- Working internet connection (this program downloads my .reg and .bat files from Mediafire)
  
# Features
- Automatic file cleaner
- Enable high-performance tweaks
- Disable unwanted services that can cause slow-down
- Disable power saving
- Enhanced system performance
- Disable telemtry
- Lightweight, use then remove

# Disclaimer
- Changing the Windows system is not 100% safe. PLEASE MAKE A RESTORE POINT BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM!

# How to use
